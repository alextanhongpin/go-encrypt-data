# encryption


## Thoughts

- public/private key encryption is useful for transmitting data securely to third party. If we want to implement something like Corp A must pay user B to access the user's data, it should be a one time payment only, since once Corp A has access to the user's data once, it can be persisted on their side.
- there are several ways to deal with data encryption in the database, but once the user lose the password, the data can no longer be encrypted (since the password is not stored in the database)
- how to utilise two-factor authentication to improve the security?
